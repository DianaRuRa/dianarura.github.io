The aim of this study was to identify species of this group from a fragment of Andean forest and a nearby grassland at the municipality of La Calera, Cundinamarca Department, Colombia, at about 2800 m of elevation. Nine species were found, including five new species, namely Gamasellodes andinus sp. Nov., Gamasellodes intermedius sp. Nov., Protogamasellus caleraensis sp. Nov., Cheiroseius mesae sp. Nov. and Proctolaelaps colombianus sp. Nov. Morphological characterisation of all the species and relevant soil characteristics of the sites where the mites were collected are presented.},

	abstract = {Acquisition of local and global biodiversity knowledge demands immediate and long-term efforts, both tutoring new generations of taxonomists and establishing, maintaining and improving research collections. Through biodiversity studies, the entomological museum “Universidad Nacional Agronomía Bogotá” (Bogotá, Colombia) has been developed and has built up a substantial collection of scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha), with 7,052 slide-mounted specimens and close to 800 alcohol-preserved samples representing 115 species belonging to 59 genera and nine families. This insect group is exclusively phytophagous, and many species are pests on economically important crops in Colombia. Curation of scale insect specimens includes slide mounting, identification, cataloging and databasing. Ecological and geospatial analyses of field data have identified insect-host interactions, and areas of the country where new field collections should be made. Host-insect interaction analysis has shown that coffee is the host-plant with the largest number of associated scales, Rhizoecus cacticans (Hambleton, 1946) and Rh. colombiensis Ramos \& Caballero, 2016 are the scale species with the largest host-plant range; and Geococcus coffeae Green, 1933 and Puto barberi (Cockerell, 1895) are the commonest scale species. Altitudinal and geographic distribution analysis have shown that sampling efforts have been concentrated in the central region, while the northern and southeastern regions of Colombia have been poorly collected. These analyses provide a guideline for future studies, such as which zones should be sampled and which host-plant species have information gaps in their documented distributions and scale insect-host interactions. The museum’s large number of specimens, species diversity representation and rich associated biological data indicate that the scale insect collection of the “Universidad Nacional Agronomía Bogotá” entomological museum is the most important in Colombia.},

	abstract = {© 2016, Universidad Nacional de Colombia. All rights reserved. Changes in composition, density and spatial distribution on the litter edaphic fauna between two land uses (a coffee plantation and a tropical Andean forest) were established, in order to understand the soil use effects. Also, the relationships between the biotic variables and some litter features were evaluated. Superficial litter samples were collected during dry season. The edaphic fauna was extracted manually and with modified Berlese funnels; it was identified up to the lower taxonomic level and classified in functional groups. Differences in fauna composition were observed between the two land uses. Composition similarity was lower than 50 \% for almost all functional groups found, but total density did not differ between the land uses. In general, there was a high variation in density among samples resulting in higher coefficients of variation for different taxonomic groups and consequently low detectability of spatial pattern. However a spatial pattern was detected only for Coleoptera, Diptera larvae and litter biomass in th e coffee plantation. The structure in forest was more difficult to detect, due to the smaller patches on it. The variance of abundance was significantly higher in the coffee plantation for all groups, except Acaridida and Formicidae. Density of Formicidae increased with the enhancement of litter moisture, but only in the coffee plantation. In conclusion, the establishment of coffee plantation differentially affects taxa and functional groups of soil fauna. This is the basis for establishing the effects of soil change use, and the environmental factors associated with spatial distribution of edaphic fauna.},

	abstract = {Soil predatory mites feed on a diverse diet making them excellent candidates for conservation biocontrol. Free-living nematodes (FLN) are commonly found in soils and serve as prey for many acarine predators. Our goal was to determine whether conservation biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes by predators could be enhanced by provisioning FLN with their culture medium (FLNCM) under semi-field conditions. We conducted two experiments on dwarf tomato plants, the first until the beginning of flowering and the second until harvest. The treatments evaluated were with and without: 1) the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, 2) the predator Stratiolaelaps scimitus, and 3) the FLN Rhabditella axei in its culture medium. In both experiments, gall abundance was lowest in the combined treatment of FLN and predators. Similar reduction in gall abundance occurred when only predators or only FLNCM was added to the soil mix. Additionally, in the FLNCM treatment, foliar macronutrients N and K were significantly higher than the negative control. Our original aim was to use FLN as a supplementary food source for predators in conservation IPM. Based on the significant reduction in gall numbers, and the increase in foliar macronutrients, it is clear that the FLNCM treatment played additional roles. Finally, for demonstration, the predation of M. incognita was visualized in high resolution imaging using a low-temperature-scanning electron microscope. Accordingly, we recommend that future research focus on identifying soil amendments that will foster the establishment of beneficial microbiota, FLN and soil predators for the conservation biological control of soil pests.},

Strategies for its control are currently based on the use of chemical products. In a recent survey, Gaeolaelaps aculeifer (Canestrini) and Parasitus bituberosus Karg, two soil-dwelling predatory mite species (Acari: Mesostigmata), were found associated with this crop at Boyacá department, Colombia. Given that T. tabaci spends its pre-pupal and pupal stages in the soil, this study was conducted to evaluate the predation and oviposition of G. aculeifer and P. bituberosus on these developmental stages under laboratory conditions. The predators consumed up to 6.8 ± 0.52 and 6.9 ± 0.45 T. tabaci pre-pupae/ pupae, respectively, when offered 6 –10 prey a day. The maximum oviposition rates were 4.4 ± 0.25 eggs/female/day for G. aculeifer and 6.9 ± 0.26 eggs/female/day for P. bituberosus, with a mean egg viability higher than 91\% for both predators. These results suggest that the evaluated predators may affect the population of T. tabaci under field conditions, and that the conduction of complementary studies on those predators is warranted, envisioning their practical use for T. tabaci control in Colombia.},

	abstract = {Little is known on predatory soil mites in Colombia, which limits their use in Biological control. This study aimed to identify an acarine predatory species of the major roseproducing region of the country, and the evaluation of this potential predator for use in the management of thrips, the most important pest group on rose cultivation in Colombia. Samplings were carried out in the Bogotá plateau, especially in rose fields, an agroecosystem of great economic importance in the country and with problems of pests that have part of their life cycle in the soil. Gaeolaelaps aculeifer (Canestrini) was one of the most frequently found predator species in all sampling dates (August 2016 - December 2017). Considering the natural presence of G. aculeifer in the Bogota plateau and that this predator is presently used in other countries for the control of different pests including thrips, studies about the biology of this new population, its potential as a biological control agent against Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thripidae) and their production in that country were conducted. With the first laboratory results it was observed that the biological characteristics of the Colombian population of G. aculeifer are comparable to those reported for other populations of the same predator. The presence of an alternative or complementary prey Aleuroglyphus ovatus reduced the rate of predation, but no differences in biological capacity of the mites with both preys (individually and together) were observed. Accordingly, this prey with coconut fiber or rice husk as a substrate was used for its production in small scale and for its release in an experiment in pots. These releases led to a reduction of damage caused by F. occidentalis compared to the negative control. To conclude, the Colombian population of G. aculeifer can be considered for pest management in Colombian soils and that A. ovatus can be used for its small scale mass production (with substrates as coconut fiber or rice husk) and as a complementary diet in predator field releases.},

	abstract = {Mites of the genus Rhizoglyphus (Acari: Acaridae) are serious pests of plants belonging to the orders Liliales and Asparagales such as onions, garlic, lilies, and tulips. Their control by synthetic pesticides is becoming problematic as a result of resistance development in these mites and environmental and health issues. New pest control methods thus need to be developed. This review provides an overview of studies related to bulb mite management. Entomopathogenic fungi and generalist predatory mites are prospective agents for biological control of these pests while entomopathogenic nematodes and the metabolites of their symbiotic bacteria seems to be less effective. There are, however, many more organisms in the soil that might play important roles in biological control of bulb mites as well as other soil pests of these bulbous plants. Therefore, a holistic approach based on the understanding of food webs in the soil environment and their ecological services is essential for developing effective control of bulb mites. For the rehabilitation and conservation of soil biodiversity supporting these ecosystem services, emphasis must be placed on sustainable soil management (e.g., ensuring green coverage, minimal soil disturbance and high content of organic matter).},

	abstract = {Numerous lab and field studies have reported the potential of soil predatory mites for the biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes and arthropods pests. Most of these studies have utilized biocontrol agents in augmentative releases, essentially controlling the pest with the released predators. While this may be a valid approach, we hypothesize that conservation of soil mite predators with available, suitable, and accessible free-living nematodes as prey, will provide better agricultural ecosystem performance and long-range sustainability. In this manuscript, we review the relevant studies on soil predatory mite\&ndash;nematode interactions and highlight their potential for conservation biological control of soil-borne pests. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of implementing environmentally sound soil management practices for the sustainability and conservation of functional soil food webs.},

	abstract = {Pest suppression is one of the desirable functions of a healthy soil. Predatory Mesostigmata soil mites, with their high degree of omnivory, are one of the most remarkable groups performing this beneficial role. Food web bottom-up effects are important for the fitness of these predators, which ultimately affects their potential as biocontrol agents. In below-ground systems, free-living nematodes (FLN) are an important diet for mites, providing essential nutrients such as omega 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-LC PUFAs). Here we assess the food quality of nematodes for the maintenance of predator fitness, i.e. development, reproduction and lipid content. We selected two mite species, different in size and morphology, collected from vegetable crops in Israel. Additionally, five species of FLN were isolated from the same fields. Additionally, one plant-parasitic species, common across arable sites in Israel, and maintained on tomato as host, was tested. Depending on species and trophic group, nematodes varied in fatty acid profile, and both mite species generally reflected the fatty acid pattern of their diet. All nematode species were able to produce ω3-LC PUFA de novo, except the bacterial feeder Acrobeloides bodenheimeri, which had the highest proportion of ω6-PUFA. Interestingly, the latter lacking ω3-LC PUFA, was the best diet for both mites. Macrocheles aff. scutatus, a medium-sized mite with a holodorsal shield, fed and developed on all nematodes except the entomophilious Oscheius tipulae. It was able to complete its development feeding on the plant parasitic Meloidogyne incognita, yet the reproduction was almost zero. The smaller and slender Protogamasellopsis zaheri, with a split dorsal shield, developed and reproduced with all nematodes, with M. incognita as an intermediate diet. Our results demonstrate that nematode species vary in their nutritional quality as prey. However, food quality is predator species dependent, likely affecting biocontrol efficacy. Besides ω3-LC PUFA, ω6-PUFA can play an important role in the reproductive and developmental parameters of mesostigmatid mites; yet, other factors such as nematode size and behaviour have to be considered.},
